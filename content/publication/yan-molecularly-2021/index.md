abstract: Abstract The J‐aggregation of dye‐functional group conjugates, which results
  in intriguing photophysical properties and highly ordered structures, has several
  advantages over that of monomeric dyes and exhibits augmented performance compared
  to that of monomeric functional groups, thereby providing a novel platform for devising
  materials with advanced functions. Herein, it is reported that a molecularly engineered
  nanodisc by the antiparallel J‐aggregation of halogenated BODIPY‐Gd(III), a dye‐functional
  group conjugate. The highly directional halogen‐bonding interactions enable a unique
  antiparallel J‐stacking of BODIPY‐Gd(III), resulting in an alternating, orderly
  arrangement of the functional Gd(III) groups on the surfaces of the nanodisc, and
  allowing water stability and an enhanced magnetic resonance signal. Moreover, the
  J‐stacked dyes render the nanodisc with excellent photothermal performance, such
  as intense NIR‐absorptivity, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and a nearly
  non‐photobleaching capability. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrated the potential
  of the nanodisc as an efficient bimodal photoacoustic and high‐performing magnetic
  resonance imaging, and antitumor photothermal therapy agent. This conceptual work
  not only establishes a general strategy for nano‐J‐aggregates with desired dye arrangement,
  controlled size, and in vivo stability, but also advances the antiparallel J‐aggregation
  of dye‐functional group conjugates as a potential platform for multifunctional integration
  and modulation, wherein multiple functional groups and BODIPYs can be installed.
