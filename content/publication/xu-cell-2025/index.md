abstract: While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer
  treatment, limitations persist due to factors like PD-L1 recycling, immunosuppressive
  tumor microenvironments, and off-target effects. Here, we present a novel cell membrane-targeted
  J-aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation
  with photo-controlled immune activation within a single-component system. Our platform
  utilizes a unique PD-L1 ligand-dye conjugate that self-assembles into highly-ordered
  J-aggregate, maximizing the surface exposure of ligands and imparting remarkable
  NIR absorption and hypoxia-tolerant type-I photodynamic activities. Surface ligands
  facilitate multivalent binding to PD-L1 on tumor cell membranes, triggering its
  lysosomal degradation and leading to a sustained reduction in cellular PD-L1 abundance
  across diverse cell lines. NIR light irradiation then drives potent immunogenic
  pyroptosis even under extremely hypoxic conditions (down to 0.1% O2), due to the
  organelle-targeted type-I photodynamic effect on cell membrane and lysosomes. This
  targeting arises from the initial PD-L1-mediated membrane binding and subsequent
  trafﬁcking to lysosomes. Moreover, our platform enables drug self-delivery, coupled
  with the EPR effect and active targeting of tumor PD-L1, resulting in excellent
  tumor-selective accumulation (up to 9.8%ID/g). In vivo studies validate a synergistic
  antitumor immune response. This versatile strategy, applicable to various membrane
  proteins, represents a signiﬁcant advance in immunotherapy, opening new avenues
  for more effective tumor immunotherapies.
