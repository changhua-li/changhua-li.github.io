 abstract = {Endowing ﬂuorogenic probes with ultrahigh contrast is essential to increasing the accuracy of ﬂuorescence sensing and imaging. Phenolate-based D−π−A ﬂuorophores (A−DOH) belong to a big family of ﬂuorophores and have attracted increasing attention in ﬂuorogenic probe design. However, the intrinsic dilemma of weak intracellular emission of traditional A−DOH ﬂuorophores resulted in low contrast during live cell imaging. Herein, we present a general and robust approach to preparing novel A−DOH ﬂuorophores with bright NIR ﬂuorescence in living cells based on the unique halogen eﬀects. The reported chlorinated A−DOH ﬂuorophore (A1−2ClOH) has an extremely strong ﬂuorescence in an aqueous solution of pH 7.4 and living cells, which is 194 and 30 times higher than that of the traditional halogen-free analogue (A1−OH), respectively. We systematically investigated and demonstrated that the distinct −I and +M halogen eﬀects, which led to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a signiﬁcant enhancement in the ﬂuorescence quantum yield, respectively, should be responsible for the tremendous ﬂuorescence enhancement. The ﬂexible phenol caging chemistry allows one to prepare multiple NIR ﬂuorogenic probes based on the A1−2ClOH scaﬀold with high contrast for live cell imaging of a variety of analytes by introducing a corresponding triggering moiety. Moreover, the conjugated azide group of A1−2ClOH enables the integration of more functions as desired through a facile click reaction. A ﬂuorogenic probe (mitoProbe-PN) was synthesized as a paradigm by equipping the A1−2ClOH scaﬀold with a mitochondria-targeting moiety and a peroxynitrite-responsive triggering group and demonstrated speciﬁc high-contrast ﬂuorescence imaging of endogenous OONO− in mitochondria of living macrophages.},
