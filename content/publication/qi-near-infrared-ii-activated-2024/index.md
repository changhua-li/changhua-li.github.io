abstract: Photoactivatable metallodrugs combining tumor cell eradication and immune
  stimulation hold immense promise for targeted cancer therapy. However, limitations
  such as oxygen dependence, narrow visible light responsiveness, and poor immunogenicity
  hinder their efficacy in deep solid tumors with hypoxic and immunosuppressive microenvironments.
  Herein, we present a novel design strategy for transition metal(II)-coordinated
  ligand radicals exhibiting intense near-infrared-II (NIR-II) absorption, unique
  endoplasmic reticulum-targeting capability, and oxygen-independent photothermal
  performance, effectively addressing these constraints. Proof-of-concept results
  demonstrate the potent efficacy of our cobalt(II)-coordinated ligand radical (BPDP-Co)
  in inducing highly immunogenic pyroptosis in tumor cells under both normoxic and
  severe hypoxic conditions upon 1064 nm laser irradiation. This NIR-II activation
  triggers the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and proinflammatory
  cytokines, fueling a robust antitumor immune response. In vivo studies demonstrate
  that treatment with BPDPCo/NIR-II significantly inhibited 4T1 tumor growth in BALB/c
  mice with a high inhibitory rate of 85.7%, highlighting its therapeutic potential
  in tumor immunotherapy.
