abstract: Dye assemblies exhibit fascinating properties and performances, both of
  which depend critically on the mutual packing arrangement of dyes and on the supramolecular
  architecture. Herein, we engineered, for the first time, an intriguing chlorosome-mimetic
  2D crystalline Jdimer lamellar structure based on halogenated dyes in aqueous media
  by employing two distinct orthogonal halogen-bonding (XB) interactions. As the only
  building motif, antiparallel J-dimer was formed and stabilized by single p-stacking
  and dual halogen···p interactions. With two substituted halogen atoms acting as
  XB donors and the other two acting as acceptors, the constituent J-dimer units were
  linked by quadruple highly-directional halogen···halogen interactions in a staggered
  manner, resulting in unique 2D lamellar dye assemblies. This work champions and
  advances halogen-bonding as a remarkably potent tool for engineering dye aggregates
  with a controlled molecular packing arrangement and supramolecular architecture.
