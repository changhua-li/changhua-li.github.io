abstract: Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing
  off-target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather
  than commonly non-immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti-tumor
  immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein,
  we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly
  enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti-tumor immunity. The unique
  PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting capability
  and potent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR-controlled immunogenic
  pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen-independent
  manner. Moreover, both ER-targeting and NIR-activity of our scaffold can be modulated
  on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological
  and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is
  demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein-activatable NIR-agonist
  that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti-tumor immunity,
  minimizing offtarget effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors.
  This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and
  effective immune NIR-agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse
  solid tumors.
