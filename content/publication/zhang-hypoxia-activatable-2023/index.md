abstract: A unique photosensitizer with intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum-targeting
  ability and high hypoxia-tolerance was developed and used as a versatile scaffold
  to construct an activatable theranostic agent for precise photodynamic therapy against
  solid tumor. ,   A unique photosensitizer (PS), ERPS, with intrinsic endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)-targeting ability and low oxygen-depletion type-I photosensitivity,
  is developed and used as a scaffold to construct an activatable theranostic agent
  for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT). The ER-targeted feature coupled with type-I
  photosensitivity endows ERPS with high phototoxicity toward tumor cells under both
  normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, caging the phenol group of ERPS with
  a nitroreductase-sensitive triggering group provided a hypoxia-activatable PS (ERPSIm)
  that is encapsulated within a polymeric micelle to obtain a water-stable Im@NP nanoparticle
  for in vivo applications. After intravenous administration to 4T1 tumor-bearing
  BALB/c mice, Im@NP demonstrated highly efficient imaging-guided PDT ablation of
  implanted tumors. This is because the delivered ERPSIm cargos of Im@NP are specifically
  activated in the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumor, and the activated ERPS
  molecules have efficient ER-targeted type-I photosensitivity.
