abstract: Marring the reversible covalent chemistry with BODIPY dye, which is a superfamily
  of fluorophores with striking photophysical performances, would enable a panel of
  diverse dynamic fluorescent probes for biomedical applications. Herein we show that
  structural manipulation of BODIPY allows rational tuning of α-site or meso-site
  activation as well as the spectral response toward nucleophiles. By rational molecular
  design, we have obtained a highly specific and reversible GSH probe, αBD-GSH, which
  exhibits a tremendously fast and dynamic fluorescence response within the wide physiological
  GSH concentration range of 0–8 mM. We successfully applied αBDGSH to real-time imaging
  of intracellular GSH dynamics in different cell lines. In light of the remarkable
  photophysical properties and synthesis flexibility of BODIPY dyes, the current findings
  will help to design more reversible BODIPY-based fluorescent probes targeting various
  bio-species.
