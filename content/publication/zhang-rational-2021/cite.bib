 abstract = {Marring the reversible covalent chemistry with BODIPY dye, which is a superfamily of fluorophores with striking photophysical performances, would enable a panel of diverse dynamic fluorescent probes for biomedical applications. Herein we show that structural manipulation of BODIPY allows rational tuning of α-site or meso-site activation as well as the spectral response toward nucleophiles. By rational molecular design, we have obtained a highly specific and reversible GSH probe, αBD-GSH, which exhibits a tremendously fast and dynamic fluorescence response within the wide physiological GSH concentration range of 0–8 mM. We successfully applied αBDGSH to real-time imaging of intracellular GSH dynamics in different cell lines. In light of the remarkable photophysical properties and synthesis flexibility of BODIPY dyes, the current findings will help to design more reversible BODIPY-based fluorescent probes targeting various bio-species.},
