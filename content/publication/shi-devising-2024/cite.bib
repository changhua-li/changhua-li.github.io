Specifically controlling cell pyroptosis is advantageous for oncotherapy as it allows simultaneous ablation of primary tumors and activation of immunogenicity of tumor environment. Herein, a facile and robust strategy is presented to construct efficient NIR‚Äêactivated helical pyroptosis agents (PyroAs) with negligible dark cytotoxicity. It is demonstrated that the construction of four intramolecular B‚ÄêX bonds (X = O or N) within the BODIPY chromophore enforces a significant twisting of its œÄ‚Äêconjugation, yielding a variety of helical

molecules with desired high photosensitivity and negligible dark toxicity. A robust approach is established to extend

into the near‚Äêinfrared (NIR) region through site‚Äêselective incorporation of an electron‚Äêwithdrawing ester moiety. It is also proved that targeted delivery of the NIR‚Äêactivated

to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) specifically activates pyroptosis pathway by equipping it with an ER‚Äêtargeting moiety. Finally, the favorable biocompatibility, excellent antitumor efficacy, and remarkable systematic immune response of this unique NIR‚Äêactivated helical PyroAs are shown in vivo, demonstrating its potential application in solid tumor immunotherapy.},
