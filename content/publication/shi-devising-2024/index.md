abstract: Abstract  Specifically controlling cell pyroptosis is advantageous for oncotherapy
  as it allows simultaneous ablation of primary tumors and activation of immunogenicity
  of tumor environment. Herein, a facile and robust strategy is presented to construct
  efficient NIR‚Äêactivated helical pyroptosis agents (PyroAs) with negligible dark
  cytotoxicity. It is demonstrated that the construction of four intramolecular B‚ÄêX
  bonds (X = O or N) within the BODIPY chromophore enforces a significant twisting
  of its œÄ‚Äêconjugation, yielding a variety of helical  H BD  molecules with desired
  high photosensitivity and negligible dark toxicity. A robust approach is established
  to extend  H BD  into the near‚Äêinfrared (NIR) region through site‚Äêselective incorporation
  of an electron‚Äêwithdrawing ester moiety. It is also proved that targeted delivery
  of the NIR‚Äêactivated  H BD‚ÄêER  to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) specifically activates
  pyroptosis pathway by equipping it with an ER‚Äêtargeting moiety. Finally, the favorable
  biocompatibility, excellent antitumor efficacy, and remarkable systematic immune
  response of this unique NIR‚Äêactivated helical PyroAs are shown in vivo, demonstrating
  its potential application in solid tumor immunotherapy.
