abstract: 'Abstract  Photodynamic therapy is an alternative modality for the therapy
  of diseases such as cancer in a minimally invasive manner. The essential photosensitizer,
  which acts as a catalyst when absorbing light, converts oxygen into cytotoxic reactive
  oxygen species that ablate malignant cells through apoptosis and/or necrosis, destroy
  tumor microvasculature, and stimulate immunity. An activatable photosensitizer whose
  photoactivity could be turned on by a specific disease biomarker is capable of distinguishing
  healthy cells from diseased cells, thereby reducing off‐target photodamage. In this
  Minireview, we highlight progress in activatable organic photosensitizers over the
  past five years, including: (i) biorthogonal activatable BODIPYs; (ii) activatable
  Se‐rhodamine with single‐cell resolution; (iii) silicon phthalocyanine targeting
  oxygen tension; (iv) general D‐ π ‐A scaffolds; and (v) AIEgens. The potential challenges
  and opportunities for developing new types of activatable organic photosensitizers
  to overcome the hypoxia dilemmas of photodynamic therapy are discussed.'
