abstract: Abstract Utilizing the J‐stacking of dyes to drive the assembly of amphiphilic
  polymers can not only construct supramolecular assemblies with novel architectures
  but also provide a stabilizing solution for dye J‐aggregation to promote its biomedical
  applications. However, tightly entangled hydrophobic segments can disrupt the orderly
  arrangement of dye molecules, thereby preventing dye stacking‐driven supramolecular
  assembly of block copolymers. Herein, a “molecular glue” strategy is reported that
  uses the small dye molecule as a molecular glue to restore the J‐stacking of the
  dye moiety immobilized on the polymer, thereby dominating the supramolecular assembly
  of the polymer matrix. Very interestingly, the yielded nano‐assembly exhibits a
  novel worm‐like structure with alternating straight and bent segments. By passing
  through nanopores, the bent part is disassembled to afford short nanorod NR‐J812
  mainly composed of crystalline dye J‐aggregates. It shows favorable colloidal and
  optical stability, suitable size, and high photothermal property, and demonstrates
  high performance in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of tumors in
  vivo. This work provides important insights into not only the self‐assembly of amphiphilic
  polymers with novel supramolecular architectures but also the preparation of J‐aggregate
  materials applicable in vivo, which bring great promise to the biomedical fields.
