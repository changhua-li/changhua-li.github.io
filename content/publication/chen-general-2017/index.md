abstract: A general approach toward highly ﬂuorogenic probes across the visible spectrum
  for various analytes oﬀers signiﬁcant potential for engineering a wide range of
  bioprobes with diverse sensing and imaging functions. Here we show a facile and
  general strategy that involves introducing a new ﬂuorogenic mechanism in boron dipyrromethene
  (BODIPY) dyes, based on the principle of stimuli-triggered dramatic reduction in
  the electron-withdrawing capabilities of the meso-substituents of BODIPYs. The ﬂuorogenic
  mechanism has been demonstrated to be applicable in various BODIPYs with emission
  maxima ranging from green to far red (509, 585, and 660 nm), and the synthetic strategy
  allows access to a panel of highly ﬂuorogenic bioprobes for various biomolecules
  and enzymes (H2O2, H2S, and protease) via introducing speciﬁc triggering motifs.
  The potency of the general design strategy is exempliﬁed by its application to develop
  a mitochondria-targeting far-red probe capable of imaging of endogenous H2O2 in
  living cells.
