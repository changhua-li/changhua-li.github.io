 abstract = {A general approach toward highly ﬂuorogenic probes across the visible spectrum for various analytes oﬀers signiﬁcant potential for engineering a wide range of bioprobes with diverse sensing and imaging functions. Here we show a facile and general strategy that involves introducing a new ﬂuorogenic mechanism in boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, based on the principle of stimuli-triggered dramatic reduction in the electron-withdrawing capabilities of the meso-substituents of BODIPYs. The ﬂuorogenic mechanism has been demonstrated to be applicable in various BODIPYs with emission maxima ranging from green to far red (509, 585, and 660 nm), and the synthetic strategy allows access to a panel of highly ﬂuorogenic bioprobes for various biomolecules and enzymes (H2O2, H2S, and protease) via introducing speciﬁc triggering motifs. The potency of the general design strategy is exempliﬁed by its application to develop a mitochondria-targeting far-red probe capable of imaging of endogenous H2O2 in living cells.},
