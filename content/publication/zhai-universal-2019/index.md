abstract: Activatable photosensitizers (aPSs) sensitive to specific stimuli hold potential
  for targeting multiple disease biomarkers and are desirable for photodynamic therapy
  (PDT). Presented herein is the design of aPSs that can be activated and fully recover
  from an inhibited state in the presence of specific biomarker. A designed long-wavelength
  Dp-A photosensitizer, PSSe-I, with highly efficient photosensitivity for generation
  of 1O2 was used. Caging of the phenolate donor of PSSe-I with a biomarker-sensitive
  group provided ALPPS, and the drastic activation of its photosensitivity was demonstrated
  intracellularly. To enhance the flexibility of the design strategy, a clickable
  azide group was introduced into the scaffold to allow integration of more functionality.
  Modularly derived mito-PNPS, equipped with a mitochondria-targeting group and a
  specific peroxynitrite-reactive trigger, was synthesized and demonstrated superior
  performance in cells. This strategy could lead to customization of aPSs applicable
  to a specific PDT.
