abstract: The design of organic photothermal agents (PTAs) for in vivo applications
  face a demanding set of performance requirements, especially intense NIR-absorptivity
  and suﬃcient photobleaching resistance. J-aggregation oﬀers a facile way to tune
  the optical properties of dyes, thus providing a general design platform for organic
  PTAs with the desired performance. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy
  to build a water-stable, nonphotobleaching, and NIR-absorbing nano-PTA (J-NP) from
  J-aggregation of halogenated BODIPY dyes (BDP) for eﬃcient in vivo photothermal
  therapy. Multiple intermolecular halogen-bonding and π−π stacking interactions triggered
  the formation of BDP J-aggregate, which adsorbed amphiphilic polymer chains on the
  surface to provide PEGylated sheetlike nano-J-aggregate (J-NS). We serendipitously
  discovered that the architecture of J-NS was remodeled during a long-time ultraﬁltration
  process, generating a discrete spherical nano-J-aggregate (J-NP) with controlled
  size. Compared with J-NS, the remodeled J-NP signiﬁcantly improved cellular uptake
  eﬃciency. J-aggregation brought J-NP striking photothermal performance, such as
  strong NIR-absorptivity, high photothermal conversion eﬃciency up to 72.0%, and
  favorable nonphotobleaching ability. PEGylation and shape-remodeling imparted by
  the polymer coating enabled J-NP to hold biocompatibility and stability in vivo,
  thereby exhibiting eﬃcient antitumor photothermal activities. This work not only
  presents a facile J-aggregation strategy for preparing PTAs with high photothermal
  performance but also establishes a supramolecular platform that enables the appealing
  optical functions derived from J-aggregation to be applied in vivo.
