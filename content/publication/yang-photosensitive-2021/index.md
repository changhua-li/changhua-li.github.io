abstract: 'Abstract  Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which utilizes photosensitizer to
  convert molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) upon laser irradiation to
  ablate tumors, will exacerbate the already oxygen shortage of most solid tumors
  and is thus self‐limiting. Herein, a sophisticated photosensitive polymeric material
  (An‐NP) that allows sustained 1 O 2 generation and sufficient oxygen supply during
  the entire phototherapy is engineered by alternatively applying PDT and photothermal
  therapy (PTT) controlled by two NIR laser beams. In addition to a photosensitizer
  that generates 1 O 2 , An‐NP consists of two other key components: a molecularly
  designed anthracene derivative capable of trapping/releasing 1 O 2 with superior
  reversibility and a dye J‐aggregate with superb photothermal performance. Thus,
  in 655 nm laser‐triggered PDT process, An‐NP generates abundant 1 O 2 with extra
  1 O 2 being trapped via the conversion into EPO‐NP; while in the subsequent 785 nm
  laser‐driven PTT process, the converted EPO‐NP undergoes thermolysis to liberate
  the captured 1 O 2 and regenerates An‐NP. The intratumoral oxygen level can be replenished
  during the PTT cycle for the next round of PDT to generate 1 O 2 . The working principle
  and phototherapy efficacy are preliminarily demonstrated in living cells and tumor‐bearing
  mice, respectively.'
