Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which utilizes photosensitizer to convert molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen (
1
O
2
) upon laser irradiation to ablate tumors, will exacerbate the already oxygen shortage of most solid tumors and is thus self‐limiting. Herein, a sophisticated photosensitive polymeric material (An‐NP) that allows sustained
1
O
2
generation and sufficient oxygen supply during the entire phototherapy is engineered by alternatively applying PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) controlled by two NIR laser beams. In addition to a photosensitizer that generates
1
O
2
, An‐NP consists of two other key components: a molecularly designed anthracene derivative capable of trapping/releasing
1
O
2
with superior reversibility and a dye J‐aggregate with superb photothermal performance. Thus, in 655 nm laser‐triggered PDT process, An‐NP generates abundant
1
O
2
with extra
1
O
2
being trapped via the conversion into EPO‐NP; while in the subsequent 785 nm laser‐driven PTT process, the converted EPO‐NP undergoes thermolysis to liberate the captured
1
O
2
and regenerates An‐NP. The intratumoral oxygen level can be replenished during the PTT cycle for the next round of PDT to generate
1
O
2
. The working principle and phototherapy efficacy are preliminarily demonstrated in living cells and tumor‐bearing mice, respectively.},
