abstract: Pyroptosis is a recently defined form of immunogenic cell death that shows
  great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, almost all small‐molecule pyroptosis‐inducing
  agents (PyAs) reported to date indiscriminately induce pyroptosis in multiple cell
  types, leading to off‐target pyroptotic death of normal and immune cells. One promising
  approach to addressing this biosafety issue is the design of conditionally activatable
  PyAs that specifically respond to disease biomarkers. Herein, a general solution
  for facilely tailoring and synthesizing activatable PyAs based on a newly developed
  class of photoactive PyAs, termed PyPSs, is reported. The unique structurally encoded
  properties of PyPSs, including endo reticulum targeting, hypoxia tolerance, and
  sensing properties, excitingly meet a demanding set of performance requirements
  for constructing conditionally activatable PyAs for cancer immunotherapy. Based
  on PyPS‐1 scaffold, hypoxia‐activatable PyPS‐NF as a proof‐of‐concept example is
  prepared, demonstrating specific hypoxia‐activated pyroptotic cell death and favorable
  immunotherapeutic efficacy of solid tumors. Herein, a general design strategy for
  tailoring activatable PyAs to precisely control GSDME‐mediated cell pyroptosis is
  established, with great potential to advance cancer immunotherapy.
