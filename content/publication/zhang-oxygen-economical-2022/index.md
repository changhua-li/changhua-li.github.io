abstract: An oxygen-economical nano-photosensitizer via co-loading an OXPHOS inhibitor
  and a type-I photosensitizer into a polymer micelle was engineered, which simultaneously
  hinder two major tumor oxygen-consuming pathways, enabling remarkable PDT efficacy.  ,   The
  development of photodynamic nanomedicines that can alleviate intratumoral oxygen
  deficiency during photodynamic therapy (PDT) is of great significance for improving
  the therapeutic outcome of solid tumors characterized by severe hypoxia. Massive
  oxygen consumption due to vigorous cellular respiration, i.e. , mitochondrial-associated
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), is another major cause of severe tumor hypoxia
  in addition to insufficient oxygen supply. Moreover, oxygen depletion during PDT
  further exacerbates the shortage of intratumoral oxygen. In this work, we engineered
  a novel oxygen-economical nano-photosensitizer via co-encapsulation of an OXPHOS
  inhibitor (ATO) and a newly developed type-I photosensitizer (IPS) into a polymeric
  micelle of PEG- b -PCL. By controlling the length of hydrophobic PCL segments, we
  successfully optimized the micelle size to around 30 nm for enhanced tumor penetration.
  The orchestration of the two functional components, ATO and IPS, can simultaneously
  hinder the two major tumor oxygen-consuming pathways, where ATO targets mitochondrial
  complex III to inhibit cellular respiration, while IPS generates ROS through a low
  oxygen-consuming type-I photochemical pathway, enabling remarkable PDT efficacies
  in both hypoxic cells and a 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model. This work sheds
  new light on the construction of nano-photosensitizers to rejuvenate PDT against
  hypoxic solid tumors.
