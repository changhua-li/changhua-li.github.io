	abstract = {While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, limitations persist due to factors like PD-L1 recycling, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and off-target effects. Here, we present a novel cell membrane-targeted J-aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation with photo-controlled immune activation within a single-component system. Our platform utilizes a unique PD-L1 ligand-dye conjugate that self-assembles into highly-ordered J-aggregate, maximizing the surface exposure of ligands and imparting remarkable NIR absorption and hypoxia-tolerant type-I photodynamic activities. Surface ligands facilitate multivalent binding to PD-L1 on tumor cell membranes, triggering its lysosomal degradation and leading to a sustained reduction in cellular PD-L1 abundance across diverse cell lines. NIR light irradiation then drives potent immunogenic pyroptosis even under extremely hypoxic conditions (down to 0.1\% O2), due to the organelle-targeted type-I photodynamic effect on cell membrane and lysosomes. This targeting arises from the initial PD-L1-mediated membrane binding and subsequent trafﬁcking to lysosomes. Moreover, our platform enables drug self-delivery, coupled with the EPR effect and active targeting of tumor PD-L1, resulting in excellent tumor-selective accumulation (up to 9.8\%ID/g). In vivo studies validate a synergistic antitumor immune response. This versatile strategy, applicable to various membrane proteins, represents a signiﬁcant advance in immunotherapy, opening new avenues for more effective tumor immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {Endowing ﬂuorogenic probes with ultrahigh contrast is essential to increasing the accuracy of ﬂuorescence sensing and imaging. Phenolate-based D−π−A ﬂuorophores (A−DOH) belong to a big family of ﬂuorophores and have attracted increasing attention in ﬂuorogenic probe design. However, the intrinsic dilemma of weak intracellular emission of traditional A−DOH ﬂuorophores resulted in low contrast during live cell imaging. Herein, we present a general and robust approach to preparing novel A−DOH ﬂuorophores with bright NIR ﬂuorescence in living cells based on the unique halogen eﬀects. The reported chlorinated A−DOH ﬂuorophore (A1−2ClOH) has an extremely strong ﬂuorescence in an aqueous solution of pH 7.4 and living cells, which is 194 and 30 times higher than that of the traditional halogen-free analogue (A1−OH), respectively. We systematically investigated and demonstrated that the distinct −I and +M halogen eﬀects, which led to a drastic decrease in the pKa value and a signiﬁcant enhancement in the ﬂuorescence quantum yield, respectively, should be responsible for the tremendous ﬂuorescence enhancement. The ﬂexible phenol caging chemistry allows one to prepare multiple NIR ﬂuorogenic probes based on the A1−2ClOH scaﬀold with high contrast for live cell imaging of a variety of analytes by introducing a corresponding triggering moiety. Moreover, the conjugated azide group of A1−2ClOH enables the integration of more functions as desired through a facile click reaction. A ﬂuorogenic probe (mitoProbe-PN) was synthesized as a paradigm by equipping the A1−2ClOH scaﬀold with a mitochondria-targeting moiety and a peroxynitrite-responsive triggering group and demonstrated speciﬁc high-contrast ﬂuorescence imaging of endogenous OONO− in mitochondria of living macrophages.},

              Photodynamic therapy is an alternative modality for the therapy of diseases such as cancer in a minimally invasive manner. The essential photosensitizer, which acts as a catalyst when absorbing light, converts oxygen into cytotoxic reactive oxygen species that ablate malignant cells through apoptosis and/or necrosis, destroy tumor microvasculature, and stimulate immunity. An activatable photosensitizer whose photoactivity could be turned on by a specific disease biomarker is capable of distinguishing healthy cells from diseased cells, thereby reducing off‐target photodamage. In this Minireview, we highlight progress in activatable organic photosensitizers over the past five years, including: (i) biorthogonal activatable BODIPYs; (ii) activatable Se‐rhodamine with single‐cell resolution; (iii) silicon phthalocyanine targeting oxygen tension; (iv) general D‐

Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to build a water-stable, nonphotobleaching, and NIR-absorbing nano-PTA (J-NP) from J-aggregation of halogenated BODIPY dyes (BDP) for eﬃcient in vivo photothermal therapy. Multiple intermolecular halogen-bonding and π−π stacking interactions triggered the formation of BDP J-aggregate, which adsorbed amphiphilic polymer chains on the surface to provide PEGylated sheetlike nano-J-aggregate (J-NS). We serendipitously discovered that the architecture of J-NS was remodeled during a long-time ultraﬁltration process, generating a discrete spherical nano-J-aggregate (J-NP) with controlled size. Compared with J-NS, the remodeled J-NP signiﬁcantly improved cellular uptake eﬃciency. J-aggregation brought J-NP striking photothermal performance, such as strong NIR-absorptivity, high photothermal conversion eﬃciency up to 72.0\%, and favorable nonphotobleaching ability. PEGylation and shape-remodeling imparted by the polymer coating enabled J-NP to hold biocompatibility and stability in vivo, thereby exhibiting eﬃcient antitumor photothermal activities.

Herein, it is reported that a molecularly engineered nanodisc by the antiparallel J‐aggregation of halogenated BODIPY‐Gd(III), a dye‐functional group conjugate. The highly directional halogen‐bonding interactions enable a unique antiparallel J‐stacking of BODIPY‐Gd(III), resulting in an alternating, orderly arrangement of the functional Gd(III) groups on the surfaces of the nanodisc, and allowing water stability and an enhanced magnetic resonance signal. Moreover, the J‐stacked dyes render the nanodisc with excellent photothermal performance, such as intense NIR‐absorptivity, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and a nearly non‐photobleaching capability. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrated the potential of the nanodisc as an efficient bimodal photoacoustic and high‐performing magnetic resonance imaging, and antitumor photothermal therapy agent.

            Utilizing the J‐stacking of dyes to drive the assembly of amphiphilic polymers can not only construct supramolecular assemblies with novel architectures but also provide a stabilizing solution for dye J‐aggregation to promote its biomedical applications. However, tightly entangled hydrophobic segments can disrupt the orderly arrangement of dye molecules, thereby preventing dye stacking‐driven supramolecular assembly of block copolymers. Herein, a “molecular glue” strategy is reported that uses the small dye molecule as a molecular glue to restore the J‐stacking of the dye moiety immobilized on the polymer, thereby dominating the supramolecular assembly of the polymer matrix. Very interestingly, the yielded nano‐assembly exhibits a novel worm‐like structure with alternating straight and bent segments. By passing through nanopores, the bent part is disassembled to afford short nanorod NR‐J812 mainly composed of crystalline dye J‐aggregates. It shows favorable colloidal and optical stability, suitable size, and high photothermal property, and demonstrates high performance in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of tumors in vivo. This work provides important insights into not only the self‐assembly of amphiphilic polymers with novel supramolecular architectures but also the preparation of J‐aggregate materials applicable in vivo, which bring great promise to the biomedical fields.},

            Reversibly controlling the dye arrangements in living systems has great potential to realize spatiotemporally controlled photomedicine. However, tuning or even maintaining a certain arrangement of dyes in a complex living environments is extremely challenging due to the interference of the various biological species. Herein, a conceptual supramolecular strategy to engineer a switchable photosensitizer (PS) via mitochondria‐mediated dynamic interconversion between monomer and J‐aggregation, enabling specific activation of the mitochondria‐targeting photodynamic therapy (PDT) and hibernation after mitochondria damage is presented. The presented mitochondria‐mediated “activate‐then‐hibernate” PS design enables a fascinating spatiotemporally controlled PDT in which spatially controlled mitochondrial‐targeting enhances therapeutic efficacy and temporally controlled activation‐then‐hibernation averts off‐target damage during PDT and tissue damage after clinical treatment, thus offering significant potential for biological research and clinical needs.},

              The development of photodynamic nanomedicines that can alleviate intratumoral oxygen deficiency during photodynamic therapy (PDT) is of great significance for improving the therapeutic outcome of solid tumors characterized by severe hypoxia. Massive oxygen consumption due to vigorous cellular respiration,
              i.e.
              , mitochondrial-associated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), is another major cause of severe tumor hypoxia in addition to insufficient oxygen supply. Moreover, oxygen depletion during PDT further exacerbates the shortage of intratumoral oxygen. In this work, we engineered a novel oxygen-economical nano-photosensitizer
              via
              co-encapsulation of an OXPHOS inhibitor (ATO) and a newly developed type-I photosensitizer (IPS) into a polymeric micelle of PEG-
              b
              -PCL. By controlling the length of hydrophobic PCL segments, we successfully optimized the micelle size to around 30 nm for enhanced tumor penetration. The orchestration of the two functional components, ATO and IPS, can simultaneously hinder the two major tumor oxygen-consuming pathways, where ATO targets mitochondrial complex III to inhibit cellular respiration, while IPS generates ROS through a low oxygen-consuming type-I photochemical pathway, enabling remarkable PDT efficacies in both hypoxic cells and a 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model. This work sheds new light on the construction of nano-photosensitizers to rejuvenate PDT against hypoxic solid tumors.},

              A unique photosensitizer (PS), ERPS, with intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting ability and low oxygen-depletion type-I photosensitivity, is developed and used as a scaffold to construct an activatable theranostic agent for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT). The ER-targeted feature coupled with type-I photosensitivity endows ERPS with high phototoxicity toward tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, caging the phenol group of ERPS with a nitroreductase-sensitive triggering group provided a hypoxia-activatable PS (ERPSIm) that is encapsulated within a polymeric micelle to obtain a water-stable Im@NP nanoparticle for
              in vivo
              applications. After intravenous administration to 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, Im@NP demonstrated highly efficient imaging-guided PDT ablation of implanted tumors. This is because the delivered ERPSIm cargos of Im@NP are specifically activated in the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumor, and the activated ERPS molecules have efficient ER-targeted type-I photosensitivity.},

However, almost all small‐molecule pyroptosis‐inducing agents (PyAs) reported to date indiscriminately induce pyroptosis in multiple cell types, leading to off‐target pyroptotic death of normal and immune cells. One promising approach to addressing this biosafety issue is the design of conditionally activatable PyAs that specifically respond to disease biomarkers. Herein, a general solution for facilely tailoring and synthesizing activatable PyAs based on a newly developed class of photoactive PyAs, termed PyPSs, is reported. The unique structurally encoded properties of PyPSs, including endo reticulum targeting, hypoxia tolerance, and sensing properties, excitingly meet a demanding set of performance requirements for constructing conditionally activatable PyAs for cancer immunotherapy. Based on PyPS‐1 scaffold, hypoxia‐activatable PyPS‐NF as a proof‐of‐concept example is prepared, demonstrating specific hypoxia‐activated pyroptotic cell death and favorable immunotherapeutic efficacy of solid tumors.

The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting capability and potent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR-controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen-independent manner. Moreover, both ER-targeting and NIR-activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein-activatable NIR-agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti-tumor immunity, minimizing offtarget effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors. This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and effective immune NIR-agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse solid tumors.},
